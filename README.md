# Unit-14-Deep-Learning
LSTM RNNs and Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG)

Built and evaluated deep learning recurrent neural network models using both the FNG values and Bitcoin closing prices to determine if the FNG indicator provides a better signal for cryptocurrencies than the closing price data.

## Overview ##
- Prepared the data for training and testing
- Built and trained custom Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks
- Evaluated the performance of each model
